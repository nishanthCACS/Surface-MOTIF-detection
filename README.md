# Discription
The underling hypotheis is just only considering surface residues to classify the proteins' functionality.
Inorder to do this canser based functions such as ONGO Vs TSG PDBs are used.

# Approaches
 ## Deeplearning_based_approach ## 
  proposing a CNN-deeplearning model to prove the hypothesis.
  Unfortunately the lack of the structure details the results obtained not prove the hypothesis.

  Inorder to obatin more details please check the report "MOTIF_deep_learning_GitHub" attached in the folder.
  Due to continius effort of the researchers, the rapid increase in deposits of the PDB structures, this hypothis may be proved based on the idea proposed in this report.
