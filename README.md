# Surface MOTIF detection
Thesis related project

# Discription
The underling hypotheis is just only considering surface residues to classify the proteins' functionality.
Inorder to do this canser based functions such as ONGO Vs TSG PDBs are used.

These repositary contains the projects(approaches) related to my desseration work, thus the codes and reports presented in the repositery copyright reserved to ULL.

# Approaches

 ## Excaustive_search ## 
As name claims searching all possible MOTIFs on the surface of protein structure.
Unfortunately the lack of the structure details the results obtained not prove the hypothesis.

 Inorder to obatin more details please check the report "Excaustive_search_Report_Part_from_my_desseration_work" attached in the folder.
 
 
  ## Statistics_of_Patterns_find_Possible-SRS-MOTIFs ## 
This is on ongoing project of finding the MOTIFs on the surface of protein structure.
The intial statistics promosing to lead on this direction. 
 Inorder to obatin more details please check the report "Stats_SRS_MOTIF_report_Part_from_my_desseration_work" attached in the folder.

 
 ## Deeplearning_based_approach ## 
  Proposing a CNN-deeplearning model to prove the hypothesis.
  Unfortunately the lack of the structure details the results obtained not prove the hypothesis.

  Inorder to obatin more details please check the report "MOTIF_deep_learning_GitHub" attached in the folder.
  Due to continius effort of the researchers, the rapid increase in deposits of the PDB structures, this hypothis may be proved based on the idea proposed in this report.
