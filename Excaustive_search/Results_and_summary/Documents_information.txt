These folowing two documets tell the unique groups hits more than 15 among them, with the index and hits
where hits tell group fell into howmany PDBs.

	summary_ongo_chk
	summary_tsg_chk

These folowing two documets tell unique groups in all
Thats mean tsg unique doesn't have same kind of group in ongo

	summary_tsg_unique
	summary_ongo_unique
		the documents have old Index and newindex where old index can make look up to the 
		documents summary_ongo_chk, summary_tsg_chk

These folowing two documets basically made with the hashmap ids which is only used for unique group 
finding purposes
	summary_ongo_group_numbered_chk
	summary_tsg_group_numbered_chk
	
These folowing two documets PDBs satisfied by groups of MOTIFs
	summary_ongo_group_satisfied_PDB_ids
	summary_tsg_group_satisfied_PDB_ids
	
These folowing two documets PDBs unsatisfied by groups of MOTIFs
	summary_ongo_group_un_satisfied_PDB_ids
	summary_tsg_group_un_satisfied_PDB_ids

--------------------------------------------------- Extention ideas ------------------------------
	
Give these staisfied PDBs for our earlier trained archtechture and check how much accuracy it gets
or
Train the architechture with these PDBids only with data augmentation in training set,
 principal componenet analysed data is easy for augmentation 

Give the unsatisfied PDBs and check the accuracy
